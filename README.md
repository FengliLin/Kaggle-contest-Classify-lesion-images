# Kaggle-contest-Classify-lesion-images

In this project, I build an automated binary classification of skin lesions using images. The final classification model is an ensemble result using the stacking technique. The detailed models can be mainly divided into two parts: 

1) Features-based classical machine learning methods
2) Deep Convolutional Neural Network(DCNN) Based methods.
